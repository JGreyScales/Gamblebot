If you write a function starting with assist_, it will not show to the end users as a playable function

This is useful for cases where you require a helper function to be built into the game but you also require functions such as "run round"
Reference RRclass.py for example usage

the method MUST be async; even if it does not use any async attributes or methods

declaring parameter message is required for end-user game functions
declaring parameter for Dict value from the room in storage is required for end-user game functions


when returning the winner of the game, do so in this format
return [playerID of winner, payout amount, True]
the third object (True) is a failsafe to ensure that the game was intentionally closed; this is the value that will be checked by the main thread


Ensure that you have a gamestate variable within your class, this function will tell the main thread if the game is active or waiting for players
When set to True, the game is active and will be removed from the open rooms list and well as restrict users from joining
When set to False, the game is inactive
When set to 2 the game is "finished" and the channel will close and be deleted from the internal rooms list
